        <h2>Technical</h2>
        <h3>Do you shoot in JPEG or RAW?</h3>
        <p>
          All images are photographed in raw format so that we have more
          flexibility in the post.
        </p>
        <h3>Which camera brand do you use?</h3>
        <p>
          All of our cameras and lenses are Canon brand. Lighting equipment
          and supplies are from reputable brands such as Godox.
        </p>
        <h3>What camera mode do you shoot?</h3>
        <p>
          That really depends on the task at hand. Most of our work involves
          semi-automatic and manual workflow.
        </p>
        <h3>Have your camera or equipment ever failed during the shoot?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, few times in extreme situations. Hence, we have multiple backup
          plans in place to expect the unexpected.
        </p>
        <h3>How do you communicate when language become a barrier?</h3>
        <p>
          While language barriers can present challenges, in the end,
          artistry, creativity, and storytelling are all universal concepts
          that we have mastered over the years.
        </p>
        <h3>What makes your photography special?</h3>
        <p>
          Glad you asked, we process all of our work in-house. Most popular
          photographers outsource work to save time. It is an unfortunate
          reality in our industry but we do not outsource any of our work.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <h3>Is the deposit amount same for all packages?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, no. Deposit amount may vary depending on the package.
          Our first three tiers are $150 deposit and to be feasible, our
          luxury, platinum and special package deposits are 25 percent of the
          total amount.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I pay online?</h3>
        <p>
          No, in order to protect our clients and us from unforeseeable
          security breaches, we do not accept or process any payments online.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the preferred method of payment?</h3>
        <p>
          Our preferred methods are e-transfer & cash upon signing the
          contract and booking our services in person.
        </p>
        <h3>If I cancel the booking, can I get my deposit back?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, no. Deposits are used to reserve your spot. Once we
          have received your deposit, we do not accept new clients for the
          day.
        </p>
        <h3>
          If I change the reservation date, can I use my deposit towards a future date?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Generally, no, but there are exceptions. The reason for canceling
          and our availability for the future date would be considered in
          making such decision.
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you charge extra for additional hours?</h3>
        <p>
          The shooters and lighting assistants all require additional
          compensation. Plus, the additional photos taken will need to be
          post-produced which adds to our overall costs.
        </p>
        <h3>Is the price include taxes?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the price you see is the final billing amount.</p>

        <h2>Transportation</h2>
        <h3>Can you travel to our destination?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, of course. We do not charge extra for most locations within the
          Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
        </p>
        <h3>Why do you charge travel fees outside of GTA?</h3>
        <p>
          The primary purpose is to provide adequate compensation for our
          photographers and assistants for the additional time spent in
          travel. For this reason, paired with actual costs of travel, these
          fees are unfortunately necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>Have you shot at my venue before?</h3>
        <p>
          We have shot at many venues, so there is a good chance that we have.
          However, if we have not, we will get to the venue early on the day
          of and be sure to perform a thorough search operations to scout for
          ideal spots.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you have liability insurance?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. Many venues require the photographer to have Liability
          Insurance.
        </p>
        <h2>Reservation</h2>
        <h3>How do I book your services for the event?</h3>
        <p>
          All reservations are confirmed once we receive your signed contract
          and deposit.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I make reservation online?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we will process online reservation requests; however, deposit
          is required to confirm your reservation.
        </p>
        <h3>Can I see a full event from start to finish?</h3>
        <p>
          Of course. We pride ourselves on the consistency of our work. That
          is why we encourage all of our potential clients to view full events
          from all photographers they meet with to see how well the
          photographer performs throughout the day.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How do I set up an appointment to meet you in person and see some of
          your work?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Please contact us, we will strive to make the arrangements for you.
          Due to time and availability restrictions, we do not travel outside
          of Toronto.
        </p>
        <h3>
          I am busy and will not be able to meet. Are there any other options?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Just let us know what information you need and we will do our best
          to accommodate your request. For example, if you would like to see
          more of our work, we can gladly show you complete events online. If
          you would like to talk about packages and get a sense of our
          personality, that can be arranged as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Service</h2>
        <h3>
          Do you take headshots, individual portraits, group pictures, product
          showcase and other types of photography?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most definitely, we have experience in many fields of photography.
          Notably, majority of our work involves creating amazing portraits.
        </p>
        <h3>What happens if I go over the contracted amount of time?</h3>
        <p>
          We understand that not everything goes as planned during the event.
          In such circumstances, we will ask you at the end of your contracted
          time whether you would like to extend. Upon your request, we will
          charge the rates as specified in the contract rounded to 30-minute
          increment.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you provide prints or photo albums with your services?</h3>
        <p>
          No. Over the years, online sharing of photographs have overtaken
          demand for professional photo prints. And, that helped us lower the
          operating cost; which, we are passing onto our clients through no
          frills pricing solutions.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you offer any discounts?</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, no. Our prices requirement for us to have a
          sustainable business. However, we will have promotional shoots time
          to time once we have met our monthly quota. Please follow us on
          social media to take advantage of any marketing specials.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Can I modify one of your service packages to suit my situation?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Of course, though we prefer not to. The predetermined packages help
          us offer maximum savings.
        </p>
        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <h3>Do you post process all the images?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, we do. Every image we deliver is post produced with our unique
          signature style of post-production. The process involves color
          correction, exposure adjustment, clarity adjustments, tone-mapping,
          and other necessary corrections.
        </p>
        <h3>How many images do you typically deliver?</h3>
        <p>
          We typically deliver anywhere from 50-60 images per hour of shoot.
          Keep in mind these numbers may increase or decrease depending on the
          event and the number of activities needing to be captured.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you deliver every image you shoot?</h3>
        <p>
          No. We eliminate duplicate images, test shots, missed focused shots,
          shots with poor expressions and other images that may weaken the
          overall shoot. With our expertise of processing thousands of images
          each year, we may eliminate ones that we feel are not up to its
          potential and only deliver the best ones.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you share all your images online?</h3>
        <p>
          No, we only share some images for promotional and customer
          engagement purposes on our digital platforms.
        </p>
        <h3>Do you provide the RAW files?</h3>
        <p>
          Each of our packages comes with a full resolution image download via
          Google Drive, Dropbox or USB. We typically do not provide
          unprocessed files from our shoots because we believe in delivering a
          finished product.
        </p>
        <h3>
          I prefer not share any of my images online. Can I still book your
          services?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely, yes. We respect your wishes, no explanations necessary.
          Please let us know in advance.
        </p>
        <h3>What if I lose my images?</h3>
        <p>
          There is a fifty dollar ($50.00) replacement charge for additional copies after the
          event has been archived. We strongly suggest you make at least one
          copy of the download when you receive it from us.
        </p>
        <h3>What rights do I have on my images?</h3>
        <p>
          You have all the right to print or share your images as you wish.
          However, you may not sell your images for profit without a written
          consent from us.
        </p>
        <h3>What is the maximum size can I print my photos?</h3>
        <p>
          In most cases, you can print your photos up to 20 by 30 inches without
          any loss of quality. If you would like to print larger than 20×30,
          please let us know.
        </p>
        <h3>When can I expect to get all the pictures?</h3>
        <p>
          Your images will be completed no more than eight (8) weeks after the date of
          the shoot. If you require the images to be completed prior, a rush
          edit fee of $150.00 will be applied.
        </p>
        <h3>But, I know a photographer……? </h3>
        <p>Usually, such questions have to do with some sort of expectation versus reality scenario. It would be unfair
          for us to comment on the work of another artist because there is no way for us to investigate all the facts.
          All questions have some merit and we strive to answer at our best; however, we are not perfect, we fall short
          at times. After all, creative work is subjective and comparison may not reveal any meaningful information. As
          a good business practice, all of our services, prices and conditions are publicly made available.
          Hence, we kindly ask clients to review our dedicated frequently asked questionnaires (Questions), service
          agreement (Conditions) and photography styles (Portfolio) to ensure no disappointment at any portion of our
          services in prior to reservations. At all times, customer satisfaction is our priority.
